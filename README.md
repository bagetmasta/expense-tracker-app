# Project Description: Expense Tracker

This Expense Tracker project is a React-based application tailored for personal financial management. It allows users to efficiently track and categorize their income and expenses. The app features two main pages: a 'Home' page, which displays an overview of the user's financial status including total balance, analytics of spending over time, and recent transactions, and an 'Expenses' page, which provides a detailed view of expenses filtered by date. Users can interact with a sleek calendar interface to select dates and view corresponding transactions.

The Home page showcases an analytics section with a graphical representation of expenses distributed over months, which users can filter by year. The intuitive interface also includes a list of recent transactions, providing quick access to the latest financial activities. The Expenses page is dedicated to managing and reviewing expenditures, offering a comprehensive look at where and how users are spending their money.

The application leverages React for dynamic user interfaces, Material UI (MUI) for modern and responsive component design, and TypeScript for robust typing and reduced likelihood of runtime errors. While optional, Redux is integrated for global state management, providing a predictable state container across the app. React Router is employed for seamless navigation between the Home and Expenses pages without page reloads, enhancing the user experience with fast and stateful page transitions.

Each user interaction with the financial data is thoughtfully designed to be engaging, providing immediate visual feedback that enhances the overall experience. The project is structured to meet best practices with a logical folder hierarchy, a clear GIT history of commits, and adherence to linting rules. The project is initialized with a popular starter like Create React App, ensuring a standardized setup and build process. This Expense Tracker app stands as a testament to clean code, user-centered design, and the power of React in building interactive web applications.
